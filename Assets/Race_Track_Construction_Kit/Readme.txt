A set of high quality modular race track pieces and furniture, enabling you to construct your own race course in minutes.

Each track piece is 20m square and fully tileable, allowing them to be used in any combination. Most textures are 1024 wide (2 lower resolutions sets are also included), and every material has a colour, specular and normal map.

Everything shown in the screenshots is included, including an example track.

Each track piece comes with curbs and railings on both sides by default, so simply delete these from each piece as required. Also note that each piece comes with an invisible "snap plane" that sits beneath the road; this can be used to more easily line up track pieces.

A "mobile" version of most of the assets are also available which have considerably less detail (usually around 75% less geometry). Remember to also use the medium or low resolution texture sets if you're developing for a mobile platform.

Also available for download, the Race Track Construction Kit: Add-on Pack A (https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/13149) and the Race Track Construction Kit: Add-on Pack B (https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/26559), two large sets of art assets to add additional details such as crowd grandstands, tyre walls and advertising hoardings to you race track.
